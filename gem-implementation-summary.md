# GeM Data Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a mock data generation system for Government e-Marketplace (GeM) data using real email contacts from the GeM_Resellers.xlsx file. The implementation allows selecting between two data source types - GeM and MSME - with different filtering options for each.

## Key Components

### 1. Mock Data Generation
- Created Python scripts to parse the GeM_Resellers.xlsx file
- Generated mock categories, states, districts, and products
- Created a batch of 100 valid email addresses from the Excel file
- Generated TypeScript data file with all mock data

### 2. Email Marketing Interface Updates
- Added data source type selector (GeM/MSME)
- Different filtering options based on data source:
  - **GeM**: Only batch selection
  - **MSME**: Full hierarchical selection (state, product, category, district, batch)
- Updated email recipient selection logic for both data sources
- Enhanced the send email functionality to include the data source type

### 3. Data Structures
- `GEM_STATES`: List of Indian states
- `GEM_CATEGORIES`: List of GeM product categories
- `GEM_DISTRICTS_BY_STATE`: Map of districts by state
- `GEM_PRODUCTS_BY_CATEGORY`: Map of products by category
- `GEM_BATCHES`: Predefined batches with metadata (state, category, district)
- `GEM_EMAIL_BATCH`: 100 email addresses from real GeM reseller data

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. User selects data source type (GeM or MSME)
2. Based on selection, appropriate filter controls are displayed
3. For GeM, user selects a batch which automatically selects the corresponding email recipients
4. For MSME, user selects state, product, category, district, and batch to filter recipients
5. Selected recipients can be added to the email recipient list
6. Email is sent with appropriate metadata indicating the data source type

### Technical Notes
- Email validation ensures only valid email addresses are included
- Duplicate emails are removed to ensure unique recipients
- Type definitions have been updated to handle the new data structures
- Batch assignments divide the 100 emails into 5 batches for testing

## Future Improvements
- Connect to real GeM API for live data
- Add more filtering options for GeM data
- Enhance UI to display batch details (number of recipients, categories, etc.)
- Add analytics for email performance by data source type
