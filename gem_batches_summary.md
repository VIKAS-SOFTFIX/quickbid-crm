# GeM Batches Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've analyzed the GeM_Resellers.xlsx file and created meaningful batches based on the actual data from the file. Instead of assigning the same emails to each batch, we've segmented them according to company type and email domain.

## Implementation Details

### Data Analysis
- Analyzed the Excel file to understand its structure
- Found that company types and email domains provided natural segmentation
- Identified 7 company types (Private Limited, Limited, LLP, Corporation, Enterprise, Industry, Other)
- Identified 5 domain categories (Gmail, Yahoo, Business Email, Other Personal Email, Government)

### Batch Creation
Created 5 meaningful batches with unique recipients:

1. **Batch 1: Private Limited Companies** 
   - 100 emails from companies identified as Private Limited
   - Category: Company Type

2. **Batch 2: Gmail Users**
   - 100 emails from users with Gmail accounts
   - Category: Email Domain

3. **Batch 3: Business Email Users**
   - 100 emails from businesses using their own domain
   - Category: Email Domain

4. **Batch 4: Limited Companies**
   - 82 emails from companies identified as Limited
   - Category: Company Type

5. **Batch 5: Other Companies**
   - 100 emails from Enterprise, Industry, and Corporation type companies
   - Category: Company Type

### UI Enhancements
- Added more details to the batch selection dropdown
- Created an info card that displays when a batch is selected
- Included batch information (category, type, recipient count)
- Added explanatory note about how batches were created

### Data Structure
Each batch now has:
- A descriptive name
- A category (Company Type or Email Domain)
- A type (Private Limited, Gmail, etc.)
- A unique set of recipients from the Excel file
- An accurate recipient count

## Results
- Each batch now contains unique emails based on meaningful segmentation
- Each batch has close to 100 emails (except Batch 4 which has 82, as that's all the Limited companies available)
- The UI clearly shows which batch is selected and its details
- The implementation follows the data from the Excel file as requested
